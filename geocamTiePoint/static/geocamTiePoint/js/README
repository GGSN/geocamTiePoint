Functions:
"run"

"align_images"
Aligns the scale and translation of the source image to the target image (in our case, uploaded map to Google Maps). Scale and translation values are passed in to the
optimization as initial parameters.

"powell"
Uses Powell's Method to find a local minimum of a function. No derivatives are 
needed to find the minimum.

"linmin"
Basically a wrapper to extend one-dimensional optimization function
to multi-dimensional optimization. Need to call golden section search
from linmin in order for it to be used by powell, which performs multi-dimensional
optimization. 

"mnbrak"
Given two initial points, finds three points that brackets the minimum. 
The bracket points are passed to golden section search.

"golden"
Performs one-dimensional Golden Section Search. Referenced pseudo-code in 
Numerical Recipes.

"f1dim"
Breaks down the multidimensional function to one-d function for golden to handle

"func"
Multi-dimensional function. In our case, we use the least-squares constuct to
